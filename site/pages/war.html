                            War has existed as long as humanity has. From tribal wars to modern cyber wars. Each
                            opposing group is trying to gain a tactical
                            advantage. Communication is an important part of the planning. Delivering and getting the
                            orders to the soldiers and between commandants.
                            Encryption has a long history. We can see it in the Roman society with Julius Caesar. He was
                            known for using the Caeser cypher.
                            Which today is laughable in terms of the offered security. Since, encryption has become more
                            sophisticated. Cracking the ennemies communications lets
                            you know their next move. Computers have become praised for they're fast mathematical
                            calculations being able to encrypt and desencrypt messages.

                            During WWII, Computers were used for two main reasons, the first being to do calculations,
                            and the second being to communicate in an encrypted format. Calculations were made with
                            computers for many things ranging from basic addition and subtraction to planning bomb sites
                            coordinates for the Naziâ€™s. The Nazis also used computers to encrypt little messages. They
                            then transported those messages back and forth between their bases. By using computers, it
                            made it very hard for unauthorized people to read the messages as computers were very rare
                            back then.

                            The Mark 1 was created by Howard Aiken, who was part of the company IBM and the model was
                            upgraded all the way to Mark 4 over time. As we all know computers were huge back then with
                            a very small amount of storage. It was powered with electricity that was generated by turn
                            wheels on rotors, which in turn was powered by relays and switches.

                            The enigma machine was used by the Nazsis as an encryption device. It was an advanced
                            machine.
                            It offered aproximately 158 million million million possibilities. Thanks to having 5
                            changeable rotors that could go in 3 different positions.
                            As if that wasn't enough, there is a plugboard. It was used to change which letter was
                            which. If a cable was plugged in A the to B,
                            each time A was pressed it would type B. However, everything has flaws. It was cracked by
                            Alan Turing during the war to help the allies win.

                            had they were able to crack it.
                            His work was said to have shortned the war by 2 to 4 years.

                            In todays world there aren't only the traditional wars of countries invading each other. The wars have moved to the digital world.
                            Where now the goal is to obtain the others country intelligence. It can also not be agaisnt countries, hacktivists now make part of the landscape.
                            Their moral or political reasons push them to crack the code.
